            <p>I’ve been in many debates about if acceptance testing should be done in a unit test framework or a “proper” ATDD tool like Cucumber or Fitnesse. Developers will change a unit test to do what they want in a heartbeat. They are more reluctant to change an acceptance test where the criteria is separated from the code. This is a very important distinction. I think a lot of developers think of unit tests as belonging to “them” and acceptance tests as belonging to “the business”.</p>
<p>So yes, those test frameworks do suck, but they give you something that unit test frameworks just aren’t designed for. Whenever I see “acceptance tests” written in a unit test framework they just look like really poorly written unit tests, So take the extra time and use the right tool for the right job.</p>
<p>I have seen one exception to this. At Agile 2012 I attended a talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/lunivore">Liz Keogh</a> about <a href="http://agile2012.sched.org/event/e459c95d5ffa604772181091d142cb22">writing BDD tests in a domain specific syntax from within a unit test framework</a>. I thought it was a excellent idea and I have used the style on my own personal projects. I want to emphasize that what Liz has done is not entirely dissimilar to traditional ATDD frameworks. Her data, and criteria are absolutely separate from the underlying code. Even going so far as to abstract away top level controllers and domain objects behind fixtures.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the &quot;Keogh Style&quot; testing from the unit test class. Note that those are all static methods of an external fixture class. In many ways it is no different than the text file side of Cucumber. All of the work of dealing with the underlying classes is behind the fixture leaving the jUnit methods with nothing but simple asserts.</p>
<pre><code>@Test
public void canCountRegistrations() {
    givenCourse(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;Underwater Basketweaving&quot;);

    registerUserForCourse(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;barry&quot;);
    registerUserForCourse(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;gary&quot;);

    assertEquals(2, getRegistrationCount(&quot;abc&quot;));

    registerUserForCourse(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;larry&quot;);
    registerUserForCourse(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;larry&quot;);

    assertEquals(3, getRegistrationCount(&quot;abc&quot;));
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Lately quite a lot of people have been asking me about my weight. I lost over 35 lbs in about 4 months and I’ve been a little surprised at how many people have thought it was a big deal and wanted details on my plan. I don’t think anything I've done is extreme or weird. It’s mostly just lifestyle changes. I told a few people I would blog the specifics so here it is.</p>
<h2>Impetus</h2>
<p>6 months ago my father passed away from a sudden heart attack. While it was a shock, it was not surprising given his lifestyle choices. I decided that I couldn’t change my genetics so whatever else happens, I was not going to contribute to an early death the way my dad did. I didn't go into this specifically to lose weight, I did it for a healthy life and losing weight has been a side effect of that.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/sitnstand.jpg" align="right" alt="My sit-n-stand desk" />I’m a computer programmer. Not exactly the kid of job that encourages a healthy lifestyle. So I came up with a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t sit for more than 20 minutes. After that you have to go do something or at least change position.</li>
<li>If you need to use more than 1 sentence to answer a email and the person is within walking distance then go visit them. Email sucks as a communication tool anyway.</li>
<li>If you’re stuck on a problem go for a walk. Sometimes just getting the blood going helps you think of the answer.</li>
<li>At my office we have sit-n-stand desks. I highly recommend these. if you don’t have them available, start talking about it with your boss because <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sitting/AN02082">sitting can kill you</a>. I probably stand at least half the day. Also, when your tired, sit down, because standing too much can kill you too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>I “work out” 30 minutes a day, <em>every day</em>. “Working out” can be defined as pretty much any physical activity that raises the heart rate. So a long afternoon of yard work counts. When I was in the middle of dropping weight, rather than just maintaining like I do now, I was doing 60 minutes a day broken into two 30 minute chunks.</p>
<p>The most important part of this was at night. My old ritual was to put the kids to bed and then have a big glass of wine (or two) with my ass on the couch. That’s a lot of calories to consume and then sleep on. My new ritual was to cut out the nighttime wine (I still have a glass with dinner), and to not eat anything within 3 hours of bed. I started out riding an exercise bike after the kids went down. The bike has some nice variety of 30 minute programs which I could do while watching Dr. Who.</p>
<p>I also joined a gym. I picked a <a href="http://www.planetfitness.com/gyms/IA/Urbandale">Planet Fitness that’s close to my work</a>. It’s super cheap at only $10 a month. I go there for a quick 30 minute work out before lunch or in the morning. They have this thing called <a href="http://www.cybexintl.com/products/arc-trainers.aspx">“The Arc”</a> which became my favorite. I also do strength training. You can burn more calories with more muscle mass so don’t skimp on the weights and do nothing but cardio.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I’m not planning on doing a marathon or anything. I’m not pushing my body to it’s limits on this stuff most of the time. I’m just raising my heat rate to a point and getting a good sweat going. That’s all it has to be. Make it a part of your life, like brushing your teeth.</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>I have not been following any particular diet. I kind of pick and choose what I want. The main goal has been to simply make healthy choices and do so all the time. If there has been one diet that I’ve followed more than any other it would be the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mediterranean-diet/CL00011">“mediterranean diet”</a>. This is pretty easy for me because I love greek and middle eastern food. I also allow myself to eat as many raw fruits and vegetables as I want. You can’t get fat on raw apples...trust me. Here are some of the guidelines:</p>
<h3>Things that are “out”</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Large Portions</em>: I think this is the biggest thing. American portions are huge. A good rule is, don't ever go back for seconds. If you're still hungry after the first then eat an Apple or some other raw fruit or vegetable.</li>
<li><em>Meat:</em> I’m pretty much a vegetarian (often vegan) before dinner. Even then we probably only eat meat 2-3 times a week and red meat is even more rare.</li>
<li><em>Carbs:</em> I’ve swapped out american bread for whole grain tortillas, pita bread and flat breads.</li>
<li><em>Potatoes:</em> This used to be a staple of our diet. Now we eat them rarely.</li>
<li><em>Ice Cream:</em> nope. Well, maybe a spoonful when I give the kids some.</li>
<li><em>Cheese:</em> drastically cut back and eating more low fat and fresh cheeses than things like cheddar.</li>
<li><em>Fried food:</em> Get a good grill instead.</li>
<li><em>Pop:</em> If there was just one thing I would tell you to quit entirely it’s pop/soda/coke. It has zero nutritional benefit. The diet crap is no better for you...actually it’s probably worse. Just quit it all together, you’ll feel better.</li>
<li><em>Crap in your coffee:</em> same as pop.</li>
<li><em>Cakes &amp; Candy:</em> hey if your going to your niece's birthday party, go ahead and have some cake. If you're at the grocery store and eyeing the zingers, then cut that shit out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things that are “in”</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Breakfast:</em> It’s very important to get your metabolism moving in the morning. I have a bowl of regular Cheerios with some blueberries or a banana.</li>
<li><em>Hummus:</em>  I freakin love this stuff. Make or buy it made with olive oil.</li>
<li><em>Greek Yogurt:</em> Get the good stuff like <a href="http://chobani.com/goreal/">Chobani</a>. It’s 0% fat, 0% cholesterol, almost pure protein and is indistinguishable from a stiff sour cream. You can use it in cooking to replace all kinds of stuff like sour cream, heavy cream or mayonnaise. The fruit versions are great for lunch or breakfast and the kids love it.</li>
<li><em>Nuts:</em> You do still need fat to live and nuts are a great source of good fats. Peanut butter is a must but also just raw nuts. Planters makes a good snack pack of “heart healthy” nuts you can get.</li>
<li><em>Raw Fruits and Vegetables:</em> You should eat some at every meal. We go through apples by the sack. We also eat a ton of pears, baby carrots, and celery. Your system needs lots of fiber and this is where you should get it.</li>
<li><em>Avocados:</em> Another great source of “good fats” and all kind of other good things for you. I’ll eat them raw, made into guacamole and eaten with pita bread or tortillas, or on top of pizza or salad.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A note on buying fruits and vegetables:</em> We have four kids and with this diet we go through a lot of produce. If we were shopping at the regular grocery store we would go broke quickly. I highly suggest that if you want to do this to go join someplace like Costco or Sam's Club. You can get a lot of produce for not much money.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>There was a spirited discussion today about the effect of bright light glare on application color themes. A lot of discussion about solorization and saturations and such. My point in the discussion was that all of that is irrelevant because the main factor is not the sun on the colors. It's the color's impact on the glass screens reflection of the light. Dark themes turn screens into mirrors. Ever noticed that you can see your face reflecting back at you in a dark screen but not a light one? Well the same happens with the sun.</p>
<p>Here is my unscientific experiment. Same screen with Intellij put into a dark and light screen and angled such that a light is reflecting back at the camera:</p>
<h3>Dark</h3>

            <p>The other day I ran into a smelly code scenario. Not only was it smelly, it was eerily familiar. I've run into this several times in this particular codebase and I finally put a name on it. &quot;Partial Class Syndrome&quot;.</p>
<p>Now anyone familiar with C# knows that you can split one class over several different files by using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wa80x488(v=vs.80).aspx" >partial</a> keyword. It's really a pretty horrible thing to do there is a very very limited scope for it being a good idea. Generated code like web service stubs are often partial so you can add to them without extending them. Other than that partials are super crappy. They make code hard to read and understand and they encourage classes to get way too big. In fact a partial sometimes shows up in code when a class gets so big that people want a quick and dirty way to make it <em>look</em> smaller.</p>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/Three_Stooges_Intro_Card_1936.jpg" alt="The Boys" />
<p>Anyway this project is Java and so can't do partials. At least you would hope not. Yet there I was looking at three classes. We can call them Larry, Moe and Curly. These three were all basically the same class with some different methods. They had the same dependencies, they took and returned the same classes, did similar things and even had similar names. On top of that they were all held by a big model class that used them interchangeably calling one and passing it's data into the others.</p>
<p>So here I was working in Moe and finding that I needed the functionality of Curly. I was also getting confused about which class did what due to the similarity.</p>
<p>The &quot;fix&quot; of course was to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Merge them together. This resulted in a pretty huge class which I was uncomfortable with but at least it solved the ambiguous confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplify the model's use of the code to just let the new big class handle the back and forth with it's own methods. This actually resulted in a lot of methods being removed or made private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract smaller specialty classes that deal with unique things. I'm still doing this step. This is always the hard part but if you look carefully you can find the classes hidden in there. Pay particular attention to feature envy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I ended up with a single class that is smaller than the three from before and something that's easier to read and understand. It’s still too big for my taste but It’s better than what was there before...at least for now.</p>

            <p>Back in the 90’s when Netscape was trying to figure out how to add scripting to HTML a lot of things were considered including Java, Python, Tcl and Perl. Eventually Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 10 days and the rest is history.</p>
<p>But what if it had played out differently? In the early running Tcl was a favorite but was ruled out for not being “Javaish” enough. What if it had been picked? I imagine we would be in about the same situation we are today. It would have been dismissed in the early days as underpowered and slow. Then as browsers became faster and tools like “tclQuery” became more robust it would have gained in popularity. Eventually as the Stockholm syndrome set in someone would extract Google’s Tcl engine into a server side platform and hipsters everywhere would form start-ups using “Node.Tcl”.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/nodetcl.png" alt="Node.Tcl" /> <br /></p>
<p>JavaScript didn’t get where it is today because it’s a great language. It got here because it was the only choice. If browsers had ever had the ability to natively and universally run something else as a first class language things might be different today. Will we ever have the opportunity to use anything else? I’m not sure, legacy browsers are a harsh mistress.  I do look forward to Ecmascript 6. Here’s hoping it’s not another 10 years before I can safely use it.</p>

            <p>Even though Octopres uses Jekyll for generating pages it's layout and the way they expect you to use it with Github Pages is actually quite different. This is my recipe for migrating:</p>
<h3>Layout Overview</h3>
<p>Now with Jekyll-Bootstrap your directory structure probably looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Hal9000:ryber.github.com ryber$ ls
404.html	_includes	archive.html	changelog.md	sitemap.txt
README.md	_layouts	assets		index.md	tags.html
Rakefile	_plugins	atom.xml	pages.html
_config.yml	_posts		categories.html	rss.xml
</code></pre>
<p>Your site and the Jekyll code are interwoven. You probably have it all on one branch, and when you push you push the entire thing.</p>
<p>This is not the case with the standard Octopress layout. It looks more like this:</p>
<pre><code>Hal9000:ryber.github.com ryber$ ls
CHANGELOG.markdown	_config.yml		public
Gemfile			  	_deploy			sass
config.rb		    source
README.markdown		config.ru
Rakefile			plugins
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you see here with the exception of the <code>_deploy</code> folder (which is listed in the <code>.gitignore</code> will be kept on a <code>source</code> branch in git. The contents of the <code>_deploy</code> folder will be your production branch. Almost all of your work will go into the <code>source</code> folder.</p>
<p>In order to get to the right state we are going to be a little sneaky as we move things around.</p>
<h2>Pre-reqs</h2>
<p>You will need at least version 1.9.3 of ruby. If you don't have it yet I suggest <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install/">installing RVM</a>.</p>
<p>After installing make sure you have 1.9.3 like this:</p>
<pre><code>rvm install 1.9.3
rvm use 1.9.3
rvm rubygems latest
</code></pre>
<h2>The old switcheroo</h2>
<p>OK, so what we need to do now in order to get everything into the right place is to move the &quot;main&quot; directory into a branch and keep the master in a subdirectory.</p>
<p>So first make a backup copy of our current state. and then go into the original.</p>
<pre><code>cp -r ryber.github.com/ old.ryber.github.com
cd ryber.github.com
</code></pre>
<p>next we need to make a <code>source</code> branch where our Jekyll is going to live. After doing that delete all of the content from the branch.</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b source
Switched to a new branch 'source'

git rm -r *
git commit -m &quot;clearned out everything from branch&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Next we are going to get the octopress content and copy it into our directory without the git history.</p>
<pre><code>cd ..
git clone https://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
cd octopress
git archive master | tar -x -C ../ryber.github.com 
cd ../ryber.github.com
git add . 
git commit -m &quot;added octopress content&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now lets make sure we have a working octopress directory. When you CD'd into the dir rvm probably asked you if you want to trust the rvmc file. Do so. Now set up the app:</p>
<pre><code>gem install bundler
rbenv rehash    # If you use rbenv, rehash to be able to run the bundle command
bundle install
rake install
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are going to clone your original master branch into the <code>_deploy</code> dir. Yes this is kind of weird. The outer directory will be on the <code>source</code> branch and the <code>_deploy</code> dir will be on the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ryber/ryber.github.com.git _deploy
</code></pre>
<h2>Migrating content</h2>
<p>This is the hard part. Copy your content over from the <code>/_deploy</code> directory to the <code>/source</code> directory. This is not going to be an exact science. Take a look at what you've got and migrate as neccessary. Your milage may vary.</p>
<p>You can probably get 90% of what you need with these two:</p>
<pre><code>cp _deploy/_posts source/posts
cp _deploy/assets source/assets
</code></pre>
<h2>The _config.yml file</h2>
<p>The two config files are a bit different. You can't just copy the boostrap file over so open them both and copy the individual settings over that you need.</p>
<h2>Preview</h2>
<p>Run the site and check it out. Make sure everything is what you want it to be. When you do a <code>preview</code> Jekyll will place your files in the <code>public</code> directory (which is also ignored by git)</p>
<pre><code>rake preview
</code></pre>
<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<p>Before you do this check the Octopress rake file and change the <code>deploy_default</code> method to &quot;push&quot;. You will find it in a section at the top that looks like this;</p>
<pre><code>## -- Rsync Deploy config -- ##
# Be sure your public key is listed in your server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
ssh_user       = &quot;user@domain.com&quot;
ssh_port       = &quot;22&quot;
document_root  = &quot;~/website.com/&quot;
rsync_delete   = true
rsync_args     = &quot;&quot;  # Any extra arguments to pass to rsync
deploy_default = &quot;push&quot; 
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are going to replace your old site with the new site (at last!)</p>
<p>We need to clear out all of the files on the master branch to make way for the new content.</p>
<pre><code>cd _deploy
git rm -r *
git commit -m &quot;cleaning house&quot;
cd ..
rake deploy
</code></pre>
<p>When you do the deploy it's going to:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate the site and place the contents into the <code>_deploy</code> directory (your master branch)</li>
<li>add and commit everything present to git's origin master.</li>
<li>push the master branch to github.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last don't forget to push your source branch to github!</p>
<pre><code>git push origin source
</code></pre>

            <p>I have been working as a software developer for about 15 years and I’ve never once feared I would not be able to find a job. Through two recessions, one of which was the biggest economic catastrophe since the great depression, I’ve always had options. I don’t think of myself as a particularly special individual.</p>
<p>The first tech company I worked for (a start-up), folded when the founder’s mom pulled our funding. I had a job less than a week later. The second company I worked for was bought by a competitor. Even though I was not let go myself, my inbox and voicemail were flooded the day it was made public. I was able to leisurely browse and consider offers from all over town. Many with friends who wooed me with lunch and booze. Everyone was hiring. My co-workers who were let go all had jobs within a month. Most of the rest of the staff quit for greener pastures over the following six months. This was during the middle of the worst economic collapse in 80 years.</p>
<p>We need more programmers. The competition is fierce. I spend more than a bit of time for work just recruiting and I can tell you that it’s damn hard. Even when you have good salaries, good benefits, cool technology, and the right company culture, finding people is always hard. It’s not unique to Des Moines either. The same story is true all over the country from northern Virginia to Silicon Valley, if you are even a remotely talented programmer you can make very good money at a pretty low stress job where creativity is richly rewarded.</p>
<p>It’s not going to stop. Companies are finding they can’t just offshore their key products. The quality is just not there because good software requires good communication and that can’t happen when the developers are half a world away. Even if the quality was there we are horribly short of talented developers in India and elsewhere. Think of everything you own that has a computer in it. You phone, your car, your TV. We are painfully short of programmers and the shortage is scheduled to last for the next forever.</p>
<p>If you are a parent and wondering what kinds of jobs you should encourage your children to follow you would do well to expose them to software development. It’s not for everyone; but it’s also not looked at seriously by enough kids.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I would turn on my TI 99/4a and my only option was to program. There was nothing else. Today you have to go out and dig a little more. Still there are some great learning opportunities. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>: lets you learn to program from the safety of your browser.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alice.org/">Alice</a> is a 3d game programming environment for kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. When I say &quot;kids&quot; I don't mean &quot;boys&quot;. We are even more horribly short on girls.</p>

            <p>I’m not a fan of scrum as a methodology or sprints as a practice. I think it is ripe with inefficiencies and waste. The best explanation I can provide comes from the Greeks.</p>
<p>In Greek mythology there is a character named Procrustes. Now old “Crusty” as I like to call him would invite people passing by his place to stay the night. He had a bed for guests and he would get quite upset if they didn’t fit the bed perfectly. So he would make sure they would by either stretching them if they were too short or chopping off their legs if they were too tall. Eventually Theseus stopped by and fitted Crusty to his own bed.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/procrustes.png" align="right" alt="Crusty is helping his guest fit the bed" hspace="10" vspace="10" />
<p>Although it’s not a widely used metaphor today, writers have been using “Procrustean Bed” ever since to describe an arbitrary standard to which reality must be fit. Development sprints are often a Procrustean Bed. We place our stories into them and they tend to expand or contract to meet the time requirement. The very act of saying “this must be done in x time” seems to make the thing take x time. If it’s a simple task the developers tend to buffer it with all kinds of other things (needed or not). If it’s too big to fit then corners get cut.</p>
<p>I much prefer to just do a queue-pull method and concentrate on one thing at a time and letting that thing take the time it needs. I find that the shorter tasks take less time, the longer ones are done right and the team is more honest with the product owners and themselves about how things are going.</p>
