            <p>In the weeks since the google manifesto I’ve been thinking about what I see as a fundamental misunderstanding the nature of software development I wanted to get it off my chest.</p>
<h4>Is Programming Math and Engineering?</h4>
<p>Yes! Of course it is. Where the author fails is in narrowly defining math and engineering to traditionally male dominated professions. Historically and across cultures women have dominated domestic crafts. Weaving, knitting, embroidery, tailoring, basket and pottery making are all forms of “thing thinking” that require high-level problem solving, mathematics and a deep understanding of materials. Yet we do not value them at the same level of men’s work. This is partially due to the more temporal and replaceable nature of these crafts but it’s also because we do not value women at the same level we value men. So we call the things men do “engineering” and the work women do “crafts”. The fact that men’s traditional crafts involve stone and metal, and women’s involve clay and yarn is irrelevant to the skills needed or women’s interest in them. Just ask Hobby Lobby.</p>

<i>Weaving involves configuring complex repeating patterns of information into a machine that renders that information to new forms. (Sound familiar?)</i></p>
  </p>
<h4>Is Programming Human Language?</h4>
<p>Yes! Of course it is. When we program we have several different audiences. The compiler or runtime is one. Other developers that must read and understand our program is another. Some of the worst code I’ve ever worked on was written by coders with poor communication skills. Naming things is hard, composing code into a readable flow is hard. By applying basic composition skills to our code we can help those that come after us.</p>
<p>Larry Wall, the creator of the massively influential Perl programming language has spoken and written extensively on the connection between human linguistics and programming. Perl itself was informed and designed with linguistic principles.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ju1IMxGSuNE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h4>Is Programming Applied Sociology?</h4>
<p>Yes! Of course it is. As all programmers who have been around a while will tell you. Writing the right code is much harder than writing the code right. Programmers must be part of the process of gathering requirements and empathising with customers. We have to work hard to ask the right questions, give meaningful critiques, and understand the problems that need to be solved.</p>
<h4>Is Programming STEM?</h4>
<p>Maybe? My personal feeling is that part of the problem of getting women and men who do not conform to stereotypical “Big Bang Theory” nerdom is in the public perception and marketing of the career. We are working against a harmful and counterproductive vision of the coder as a socially awkward genius sitting in a dark room. Most programming isn’t writing router software or physics engines.  Developing software for humans requires a high degree of general purpose problem solving, teamwork and empathy. Many of the best programmers I’ve worked with did not come into programming through traditional educational paths and I’m not convinced that grouping programming with math and engineering is beneficial to it from a marketing perspective. Perhaps it should be in business, design, or even on it’s own.</p>
<p>We are also working against a toxic and misogynistic culture that drives the women who do want to engage out. The most baffling thing about the manifesto is it’s choice to basically ignore the voices of women who will tell you why they left. It’s not a mystery we need brain scans to find out. Just ask.</p>

                <p class="meta">
                    <time datetime="2016-08-22T00:00:00.000-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 22, 2016</time>
                </p>
            </header>

            <p>Velocity is a largely meaningless “measurement”. It’s relative, it’s based on estimation (which we are all horrible at), and it’s subject to all kinds of external forces that impact teams.</p>
<p>A much better thing to measure are the forces hampering our teams from delivering. I like to think of this as viscosity. In science, viscosity is a measurement for how fluid a liquid is.  Water flows faster and easier than honey. Similarly, our teams will go as fast as they are capable of. The real issue is finding what is slowing them down.</p>
<p>I came up with an entirely unscientific method for calculating a team’s viscosity. In the course of a team delivering something to their customer:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with 1 point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add 1 Point</strong> for each external team or person (not on the team) you are dependent on in order to deliver. This could be DBA’s architects, operations, security, marketing, etc etc. It could also be another team responsible for some other part of a feature. Maybe your teams are split between “back end” and “UI” for example.</li>
<li><strong>Add 1 Point</strong> for each required technology needed that your team is not proficient in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy huh? Your goal is a value of <strong>1</strong>. Obviously not all values of 1 are equal but it should give you a target to work on. You are free to play with the point system. Maybe dependencies outside of your company or area cost more?</p>
<p>Teams that are self sufficient are going to be faster or at least be more responsible for their own speed. What would it take to get a team with all of the skills and people needed to deliver?</p>
<p>Of course teams impact other teams. Viscosity is all about how a liquid moves in relation to itself. What’s really fun is to take all of the viscosity points for an organization and cross them together. So rather than just run the points of each team, inherit the points from your dependencies. So if your team is dependent on a team with a viscosity of 5 then you now also have 5 as well (plus whatever else).</p>
<p>Map this out and you will start to see the big bottlenecks of your organization. You could create a nice dependency graph and watch as it explodes. Teams that should be really fast suddenly look slow because of a web of other slow teams (usually built to “support” them).</p>

            <p>At my current gig we have a fairly large Java web application. It has a Fitnesse suite of around 2000 tests that until recently took about 12-13 minutes to run on a good machine.</p>
<p>One of our developers (<a href="https://twitter.com/briandanenhauer">@briandanenhauer</a>) felt the there was something wrong with that time and used one of our hackathons to do something about it. He ran the tests under a profiler and found a significant problem with the way we (and Fitnesse) were wiring in fixtures.</p>
<p>Fitnesse has a Import fixture which can be used to import the java packages containing your fixtures. For example:</p>
<pre><code>|Import|
|info.fitnesse.fixturegallery|
|info.fitnesse.anotherPackage|
</code></pre>
<p>Our project had attempted to package our fixtures into feature specific packages. Over time this had left us with over 50 fixture sub-packages.</p>
<p>Whenever Fitnesse needed to find a fixture it would loop over the list of imports and look in each package for the fixture. If it didn’t find it it would throw an exception up and then continue looking until it found it. This was resulting in literally millions of exceptions being thrown throughout the run of the main suite.</p>
<p>@briandanenhauer did the simple thing and flattened all of our fixtures into one package and one corresponding row in the import fixture.</p>
<p>The the result was dramatic. A full build of our system went from 13-14 minutes to 6-7! The team was floored and there was much rejoycing! <img src="/assets/images/rejoicing.gif" align="right" />
I did a very quick and dirty calculation on the savings in dev time and came up with $200,000 per year for our staff. That would be if every developer ran verify only once per workday (and we know it’s more).
That’s a powerful argument for hackathons or just letting your developers have time to make their projects better.</p>
