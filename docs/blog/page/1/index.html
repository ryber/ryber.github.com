            <p>After receiving a formal diagnosis of ADHD as an adult, it was recommended that I try mindful meditation. Initially, I was skeptical, but I soon learned that meditation has been scientifically shown to help with anxiety, depression, clear thinking, and overall health. What I did not expect was how useful it would be in programming. Software development is full of distractions and challenges, and even determining what we are trying to achieve can sometimes be a struggle.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been developing what I call ‚ÄúProgramming Meditation,‚Äù and I‚Äôm excited to share it. The foundation of this practice is regular mindful meditation. This involves sitting quietly and focusing on your breath and body to achieve a state of peace. Thoughts will inevitably arise, but the key is to acknowledge them, let them go, and return to your breath. For beginners, I highly recommend using a guided meditation app like Headspace or Calm and practicing daily.</p>
<h2>Bringing Meditation into Programming</h2>
<p>Programming Meditation integrates mindfulness directly into a coding session. Here‚Äôs how you can practice it:</p>
<h4>Set Up Your Environment:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sit at your computer with your development environment and code fully loaded in full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Close any potentially distracting applications (e.g., email, Slack, Teams).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meditate with Your Code:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Spend at least 10 minutes meditating with the computer and code as part of your environment, no different from the floor beneath your feet or the chair you are sitting on.</li>
<li>Towards the end of your session, open your eyes and transition directly into reading the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for Mindful Coding</h2>
<p>Before writing any code, take the following steps:</p>
<h4>Orient Yourself:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Become aware of where you are in the code. Imagine the code as a vast garden; take time to explore it and orient yourself without getting bogged down in details. Approach it with curiosity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Understand the Code:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If your task involves modifying an existing file, read through the entire file to orient yourself. Consider what the code does and why it was written that way. Assume the original authors had reasons for every line. Do those reasons still apply?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Code Intentionally:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Write code in small, incremental, and intentional steps. Coding should feel natural and unlabored, much like healthy breathing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Incorporate TDD (Optional):</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test-driven development (TDD) pairs well with meditation as it encourages small, deliberate steps. Even without TDD, keep changes minimal, commit often, and remain mindful of each change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of Programming Meditation</h2>
<p>Using this technique, I‚Äôve found that I can induce a state of flow (distinct from hyperfocusing, which can be unhealthy). This practice has improved the quality of my code, making it easier to read and understand later. More importantly, it has enhanced my overall experience with programming, helping me feel better about my work and its outcomes.</p>
<p>Programming Meditation is a powerful tool for improving focus and cultivating a mindful approach to coding. I encourage you to give it a try and see how it transforms your development process.</p>

<p>I'm going to attempt a small üßµ to explain ADHD in computer terms. Imagine your brain is a computer; you have working memory (RAM), long term memory (hard drive), processors (frontal cortex) and an operating system.
<p>The operating system has a process manager which takes care of all the things. Some are daemons and run constantly on dedicated chips like breathing and sensory processing. Others need to be managed to interact with the CPU (the frontal cortex) to be active.
<p>Most humans perform a type of preemptive multitasking where processes can interrupted and scheduled based on I/O waits, CPU needs, and timeslices. You can work on something until you have to go to the bathroom, or you need to eat, or just because it's time to stop.
<p>In ADHD brains the interrupt mechanism is different. It wants to do something, anything really, and when it sees CPU and I/O dipping it assumes a new process needs to be spawned and given priority. It also will randomly terminate processes.
<p>Most computers will defer to the user for what process has priority, the ADHD manager attempts to round robin task switch across all the processes without regard for what the user wants or needs.
<p>Imaging you're using a email app and suddenly out of nowhere minesweeper opens and moves to the front. You didn't ask for it, but here it is, then as soon as you finish one level it opens a new browser tab and navigates to the wikipedia article about the Ottoman Empire.
<p>There are also times when the interrupt mechanism will hand all priority to a single process and refuse to send scheduled processes to the CPU, need to eat? pee? sleep? No! Link can't save Zelda on his own, he needs me!
<p>This style of processing isn't broken, it's just a different pattern. There are times when this task switching is beneficial as not all tasks really need to be given priority. Which is why ADHD folk tend to thrive in chaotic environments that stress out others.

            <img src="/images/800px-Alice_par_John_Tenniel_34.png" align="right" alt="Mock Turtle" hspace="10" vspace="10" width=300 />
<p>Let me start by saying that I don‚Äôt hate mocking frameworks. They can be incredibly useful, and from an intellectual standpoint they‚Äôre some of the most amazing and interesting code you can look at. If you want a masters class on reflection and runtime manipulation go dig around in them.</p>
<p>What I do dislike is how they‚Äôre misused. I consider myself a classicist or a member of the Chicago/Detroit school of mocking. That means I don‚Äôt mock often, and when I do I prefer to use hand rolled mocks because I find they‚Äôre better at letting me test state as opposed to interactions. Still, sometimes mocking frameworks can be damn handy and I‚Äôm not above using them. More often they‚Äôre part of an existing application that I‚Äôm working on. The main problem I see with them is when developers don‚Äôt stay SRY with their mocking. Every time you mock a method that‚Äôs a little dab of glue making it harder to change that method. I get sad when I come into a test and see a chunk of mocking repeated over and over in every test.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">User user = mock(User.class);
when(session.getUser()).thenReturn(user);
when(result.getName()).thenReturn(‚ÄúStacy‚Äù);
</code></pre>
<p>You will often find that these same lines are repeated throughout the system in many different tests, sometimes many times the number of invocations in the production code. If you want to change <code>getUser()</code> or <code>getName()</code> you may find that difficult, not due to the prod code but due to the mocker. I've litterally spent days refactoring tests and mocking statements so I could change some method automatically.</p>
<p>We can get around this the same way we stay DRY in our production code, through encapsulation and creating common utilities. In the above example, if this happens in one test we can easily extract a method for it. If it‚Äôs in many tests we can do the same but put it outside. I sometimes end up with a set of utilities for common methods. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class SessionExpects {
     public static User currentUser(UserRepo userRepo, String name){
        User user = mock(User.class);
        when(session.getUser()).thenReturn(user);
        when(result.getName()).thenReturn(name);
	    return user;
     }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can have only one place where these methods are called and if we need to change them it should be a lot easier. We also maintain the existing tests and other usages of the mocking framework. So it‚Äôs really low risk, low change, all we are doing is not repeating ourselves, which seems simple, and yet, maybe not obvious.</p>

            <p>In the weeks since the google manifesto I‚Äôve been thinking about what I see as a fundamental misunderstanding the nature of software development I wanted to get it off my chest.</p>
<h4>Is Programming Math and Engineering?</h4>
<p>Yes! Of course it is. Where the author fails is in narrowly defining math and engineering to traditionally male dominated professions. Historically and across cultures women have dominated domestic crafts. Weaving, knitting, embroidery, tailoring, basket and pottery making are all forms of ‚Äúthing thinking‚Äù that require high-level problem solving, mathematics and a deep understanding of materials. Yet we do not value them at the same level of men‚Äôs work. This is partially due to the more temporal and replaceable nature of these crafts but it‚Äôs also because we do not value women at the same level we value men. So we call the things men do ‚Äúengineering‚Äù and the work women do ‚Äúcrafts‚Äù. The fact that men‚Äôs traditional crafts involve stone and metal, and women‚Äôs involve clay and yarn is irrelevant to the skills needed or women‚Äôs interest in them. Just ask Hobby Lobby.</p>

<i>Weaving involves configuring complex repeating patterns of information into a machine that renders that information to new forms. (Sound familiar?)</i></p>
  </p>
<h4>Is Programming Human Language?</h4>
<p>Yes! Of course it is. When we program we have several different audiences. The compiler or runtime is one. Other developers that must read and understand our program is another. Some of the worst code I‚Äôve ever worked on was written by coders with poor communication skills. Naming things is hard, composing code into a readable flow is hard. By applying basic composition skills to our code we can help those that come after us.</p>
<p>Larry Wall, the creator of the massively influential Perl programming language has spoken and written extensively on the connection between human linguistics and programming. Perl itself was informed and designed with linguistic principles.</p>

<h4>Is Programming Applied Sociology?</h4>
<p>Yes! Of course it is. As all programmers who have been around a while will tell you. Writing the right code is much harder than writing the code right. Programmers must be part of the process of gathering requirements and empathising with customers. We have to work hard to ask the right questions, give meaningful critiques, and understand the problems that need to be solved.</p>
<h4>Is Programming STEM?</h4>
<p>Maybe? My personal feeling is that part of the problem of getting women and men who do not conform to stereotypical ‚ÄúBig Bang Theory‚Äù nerdom is in the public perception and marketing of the career. We are working against a harmful and counterproductive vision of the coder as a socially awkward genius sitting in a dark room. Most programming isn‚Äôt writing router software or physics engines.  Developing software for humans requires a high degree of general purpose problem solving, teamwork and empathy. Many of the best programmers I‚Äôve worked with did not come into programming through traditional educational paths and I‚Äôm not convinced that grouping programming with math and engineering is beneficial to it from a marketing perspective. Perhaps it should be in business, design, or even on it‚Äôs own.</p>
<p>We are also working against a toxic and misogynistic culture that drives the women who do want to engage out. The most baffling thing about the manifesto is it‚Äôs choice to basically ignore the voices of women who will tell you why they left. It‚Äôs not a mystery we need brain scans to find out. Just ask.</p>
