Hi! My name is Ryan Bergman and I&#8217;m a software developer in Des Moines Iowa. I work for 
John Deere Intelligent Solutions Group where I work mostly on applications merging agronomic data from
farm equipment with web applications. <a href="http://vimeo.com/45697095">It's pretty cool.</a>
I am a big fan of agile/xp software development and I speak on the subject at user groups and conferences 
<a href="http://submit2012.agilealliance.org/node/14962">sometimes</a>.
