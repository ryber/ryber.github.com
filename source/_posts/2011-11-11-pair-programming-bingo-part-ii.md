<p>Last sprint&#8217;s pair programming bingo worked out pretty good. There was more awareness of pairing and a desire to make sure everyone filled some squares. This sprint we changed it a little. Our PO generated some cards from <a href="http://print-bingo.com/.">http://print-bingo.com/.</a> The cards are random and seem to have a better shot at actually getting bingo for someone.</p>
